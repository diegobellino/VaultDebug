# Vault Debug

Vault Debug is a comprehensive logging solution for Unity projects. It provides a robust runtime structured logging system with a lightweight dependency injection container, efficient log pooling, and an interactive Unity Editor Console for real-time log management.

---

## Features

- **Robust Logging System:**  
  Log messages at various levels (Info, Debug, Warn, Error, Exception) to help you monitor and debug your application.

- **Structured logging:**  
  Vault Debug includes structured logs by default. Simply add properties in a `IDictionary<string,object>` to your logs. They will automatically show in the Vault Console and be ready to implement any logic over them on your log handler implementations.
  
- **Lightweight Dependency Injection:**  
  Uses a simple DI container (via the `DIBootstrapper`) to register and resolve core components, making it easy to extend or replace dependencies.
  
- **Efficient Log Pooling:**  
  Recycles log objects using a log pool to reduce garbage collection overhead and improve performance. By default, it stores the last 1000 logs
  
- **Editor Console Integration:**  
  Includes a custom Unity Editor window that displays logs, supports filtering by log level, provides search capabilities, and allows log exporting.
  
- **Persistent Log Storage:**  
  Saves and loads logs using JSON serialization, enabling you to persist log history between sessions.
  
- **Main Thread Dispatcher:**  
  Ensures that log processing and UI updates occur on Unity's main thread.

## Installation

1. **Download the Package:**  
   Download the Vault Debug Unity package from your preferred source or repository.

2. **Import the Package:**  
   In Unity, go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Packageâ€¦** and select the Vault Debug package file.

3. **Setup Complete:**  
   Once imported, Vault Debug will automatically initialize its core systems through the `DIBootstrapper`.

## Getting Started

### Initializing the Logger

Vault Debug uses a lightweight DI container to automatically register core dependencies. To start logging, simply create a new logger instance with your desired context:

```csharp
using VaultDebug.Runtime.Logger;

public class ExampleUsage : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Create a logger for the current context.
        var logger = new VaultLogger("ExampleContext");
        
        // Log an informational message.
        logger.Info("Vault Debug initialized successfully.");
    }
}
```

### Exploring functionality

#### Benchmarking
You can run a benchmark to compare performance against Unity's logging system by navigating to Vault Debug > Console > Benchmark Logs

> [!TIP]
> Open the Vault Debug console first, otherwise you will not be able to see the Vault Logs, just the end result

Below is a table showcasing comparing the time it takes to log a specific amount of logs to Vault Debug and Unity Logs. Each value in the table is an average of 3 runs.

System info:
- 32 GB RAM
- Windows 11
- AMD Ryzen 9

| Log Count | Vault Debug | Unity Log |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 10        | 1 ms        | 2 ms      |
| 100       | 20 ms       | 24 ms     |
| 1000      | 550 ms      | 436 ms    |
| 10000     | 5920 ms     | 6232 ms   | 

Vault Debug performs better than Unity Logs in almost all scenarios. Unity Logs are better performing when the Vault Debug Pool fills, as shown in the test generating 1000 logs, but the log pooling system makes Vault Debug more performant when generating bigger amounts of logs too

#### Log Types
Instead of creating your own logger, it's easier to use the Vault Debug > Console > Generate test logs option in order to create some sample logs

## Using the Editor Console
Vault Debug includes an interactive console for viewing and managing logs within the Unity Editor:

- **Open the Console:**
Navigate to Vault Debug > Console > Open Window in the Unity Editor menu.

- **Filtering & Searching:**
Use the filter buttons to display logs by level (Info, Debug, Warn, Error). The search field supports text filtering and context-specific searches.
   - **Currently supported filters**
      - `@context:` followed by a string, will show only logs pertaining to a specific context. Example:  `@context:"TestContext"`

- **Log details:**
Click on any log in the Vault Console to see all its information, including:
   - Full log
   - Stacktrace (smart or raw)
   - Properties (for structured logs)

- **Exporting Logs:**
Click the Export button to save the current logs to a text file.

- **Clearing Logs:**
Use the Clear button to remove all logs from the current session.

## Editor Settings
Access additional settings via Vault Debug > Settings to configure options such as:

- Automatically opening the console on startup.
- Specifying the log export path.
- Resetting editor preferences.

## API Overview
- **DIBootstrapper:**
Initializes the dependency injection container and registers core dependencies (e.g., log pool, dispatcher, logger provider).

- **VaultLogger:**
The primary class used for logging messages. Offers methods like Info(), Debug(), Warn(), and Error().

- **VaultLogPool:**
Manages a pool of reusable log objects to optimize memory usage. By default the log pool will allow 1000 elements. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Vault Console will remove logs automatically when the limit is exceeded by the pool

- **VaultLogDispatcher:**
Dispatches log messages to registered handlers, ensuring that logs are processed by all interested components.

- **VaultDebugLoggerMainThreadDispatcher:**
Facilitates the execution of log processing actions on Unity's main thread.

- **LoggerProvider:**
Provides logger instances for various contexts.

- **Vault Console Editor:**
A custom Unity Editor window that displays logs, supports filtering, and offers features like log export and clearing.

- **Persistent Log Storage:**
Uses JSON serialization (powered by Newtonsoft.Json) to save and load logs via the EditorFileLogStorageService.

## Customization
Vault Debug is designed to be extensible:

- **Custom Log Handlers:**
Implement the IVaultLogHandler interface to create custom log processing behaviors.

- **Extend the DI Container:**
Register additional dependencies or replace existing ones using the built-in DI container.

- **Customize the Editor Console:**
Modify the UI and behavior of the Vault Console Editor to suit your project's needs.

## Known  Issues
- `Assertion failed` generates aVisual issues in the Vault Console when displaying logs while UIToolkit windows are open

## Dependencies
- **Newtonsoft.Json:**
For JSON serialization and deserialization of log data.

- **UnityEngine & UnityEditor:**
Core Unity modules used for runtime functionality and editor integration.
